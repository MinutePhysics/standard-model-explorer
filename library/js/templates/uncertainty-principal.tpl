            <p>There, that looks more like a particle. (Or maybe a quanta that's eaten an elephant?) It's localized to a certain area. But we got it by adding up quanta with different frequencies. What does it all mean?</p>

            <p>Well, quantum mechanics tells us that a quanta's frequency is closely related to its momentum (which is related to how fast it's going). So this particle somehow takes on a combination of different speeds at the same time!</p>

            <p>Physicists call this a <em>quantum superposition</em>, which in this case is just a fancy way to say: <em>the ripple is made by adding different frequencies (speeds) together so that it's restricted to a certain patch of space</em>.</p>

            <p>The more quanta of different speeds we add together, the more we can squish the wave packet. This leads to a strange outlook on the nature of reality called <em>Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principal</em>. The more we squish the wave packet, the more sure we are about its position, but the less we know about how fast it's going.</p>
