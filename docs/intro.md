Everything you see, eat, touch, and breath is made of tiny things called atoms. Or at least that's what they told you in High School, right? Atoms are a bunch of electrons that surround a nucleus, and if you look more carefully, you can see that the nucleus is made up of smaller particles called protons and neutrons.

This way of looking at the world is called "Atomic Theory", and it took many great scientific minds years to construct and validate. And Atomic Theory is great! It helps us understand a lot of things about the world that used to confuse us.

But science never stops asking: "why?".  And the more carefully you look, the more holes you find in Atomic Theory. It doesn't explain where forces like electricity and magnetism come from, and why some (supposedly) fundamental particles like neutrons, turn into other particles like protons and electrons. These gaps don't mean that Atomic Theory is "wrong", it just means there is a limit to its usefulness. After all, we don't throw up our hands and call hammers "useless" or "wrong" because they can't saw wood... 

But it would be pretty great if there were a "multitool" of some kind that _could_ hammer a nail and saw a piece of wood. To physicists, this "multitool" is called a "Theory of Everything", which is a grandiose way of saying "a theory that describes the behavior of all matter and forces".

Since atoms, physicists have made stunning leaps towards creating a Theory of Everything. Some of these leaps have turned Atomic Theory inside out, and others make us question what we take for granted about the nature of reality. [ tangent links to quantum mechanics and relativity ] Because of this, scientists have had a lot of trouble communicating them to the general public. 

The story that scientists tell usually ends at the mention of Quantum Mechanics, which describes the strange probablistic nature of particles. But there's more that you might not have heard of! Since the late 20th century, physicists have begun to describe the behavior of matter and forces, not as particles, but as small ripples in **fields**. This is the foundation of modern particle physics, and it's called "Quantum Field Theory". 

This scientifically validated theory tells us that what we think of as particles can be thought of as ripples in fields, and the ways that these fields interact with each other explain the fundamental forces of nature. And just as Atomic Theory has a specific model of what the atom is, Quantum Field Theory has a specific model of what the fields are and how they interact; this is called "The Standard Model".


## Tangent: String Theory

You might have heard of "String Theory", the idea that all fundamental particles are actually vibrations in strings. Be aware that Quantum Field Theory is different. String Theory came out of the ideas of Quantum Field Theory. And unlike String Theory, it has been tested and scientist approved. It arguably gives the most accurate scientific predictions of the world in history. String Theory, at the moment, is completely untested and even seems untestable.
